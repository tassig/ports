Some packages and some of their dependencies will be moved to applications instead

openbox
openssh?


One criteria used to decide whether a package belongs here or belongs to applications is: is this package an end user application or a library? If a library, is this used by many other high-profile applications or not?
Another criteria is: can this application work in isolation or not?



Add:
sysstat (http://sebastien.godard.pagesperso-orange.fr/)




TO FIX:
- wget has failed with: wget: bad address 'mirrors.tassig.com'
