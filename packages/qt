build_dependencies=   # there are many



# TODO:
# - this build systems does not use configure.ac, instead it uses a manually written configure, so there are some issues with it, for example it uses a bash feature in some place (near line 4600) that needs to be fixed
# - it doesn't honor the LDFLAGS, sometimes -rpath is needed. We can do such linking manually but it's tedious. We can fix it so it uses libtool.
#
# you need to use -qt-xcb to configure so qt uses its own xcb, or you would need to use Longhorn xcb we would need to add 'xcb-image', 'xcb-keysyms', 'xcb-icccm' during the x.org build.


# -skip qtwebengine can be used to reduced the build size
