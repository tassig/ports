build_dependencies=   # there are many



# TODO:
# - this build systems does not use configure.ac, instead it uses a manually written configure, so there are some issues with it, for example it uses a bash feature in some place (near line 4600) that needs to be fixed
# - it doesn't honor the LDFLAGS, sometimes -rpath is needed. I did each such linking manually. We can fix it so it uses libtool.
