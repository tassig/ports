# TODO:
# - getting this warning at configure time: WARNING: Could not find XKB config root, use -xkb-config-root to set a path to
# XKB configuration data. This is required for keyboard input support.


#
# Requirements: http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linux-requirements.html
#
# you need to use -qt-xcb to configure so qt uses its own xcb, or you would need to use Longhorn's xcb we would need to add 'xcb-image', 'xcb-keysyms', 'xcb-icccm' during the x.org build.
# TODO: it's probably better to install these xcb packages and make Qt use Longhorn's xcb instead of its own xcb
# TODO: yes, we should just install 'xcb-image' and 'xcb-keysyms' to xorg, and make qt use our xcb library
#
# -skip qtwebengine can be used to reduced the build size

	# -R : add a runtime path to libraries. The -R option adds an explicit runtime path to all Qt libraries, it would be better if it was added selectively, because it will make loading of executable and libraries slow.
