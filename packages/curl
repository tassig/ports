no_check=1   # dambaev (Aug 15, 2016): there are 2 main reasons why tests fail:
			 # 1. curl's test suit must be patched (1. runtests.pl modifies HOME
			 #	  variable and then executes $SHELL which relies on $HOME; 
			 #	  2. number of tests contains "#!/usr/bin/env perl");
			 # 2. 1026 test case is failed because it checks "curl --manual", to
			 # solve this, man-db must be installed, which requires to install
			 # libpipeline, groff, gdbm and patch configure.ac to search for
			 # zlib, because build will be failed due to missing zlib.h
