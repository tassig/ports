# this package is used by Axiom bootstrap build, in particular mkfs.ext4, by build-image script
# version 1.42.12 is being used, since versions > 1.43 were introducing additional default options, which made bootstrap root filesystem inaccessible for syslinux
# According to http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/e2fsprogs-release.html, this change occured in 1.43 version
# "Mke2fs will now create file systems with the metadata_csum and 64bit features enabled by default."
# Alternatively we can change the build-image script, and use latest e2fsprogs version

# custombuild, because we need to perform 'make install-libs' as well as install
