# NOTE: run as root, bluetoothctl needs to access DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS  

# start bluetoothctl in unix socket patched mode, to allow btsetup to connect and run commands
/opt/bluez/bin/bluetoothctl --unix-socket-backend /tmp/bluetooth.unix

# NOTE: patched bluetoothctl will change ownership of /tmp/bluetooth.unix to 1001:1001, so btsetup can access it
