build_dependencies=libpng   # this isn't a hard dependency, and freetype can also build without it, however we will probably need freetype with harfbuzz and libpng soon enough

# freetype depends on zlib, and zlib doesn't use libtool, so surely we should provide the -rpath manually to the linker?
# yes, but here we cheated, by installing libpng first, which put the rpath for us in the resulting freetype binaries
