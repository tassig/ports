# zlib does not create a .la by default, which makes it significantly more annoying to link against, because we can't use libtool, so we have to path the -rpath to the linker manually
# a problematic package would be fontconfig, which uses libtool, thus ignoring your LDFLAGS
# as a result, we still put the shared lib into the dynamic linker path
# TODO: another alternative would be to add libtool support for zlib, which is not too hard
