# this is a minimal version of git for bootstrapping purposes
# it lacks some features essential to git, however it's able to clone repositories, which is all we need for bootstrapping
# TODO: this package should be renamed git-minimal, the real git package shouldn't have these restrictions

# TODO: git with http or https doesn't work, it doesn't seem to use curl. It doesn't really matter for bootstrapping purposes
